Hello there! I am a second-year Masters's Student and a part of the Advanced Computing program in the Computer Science and Technology department at Tsinghua University. I am also currently part of the [Conversational AI (CoAI) Lab](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) as a Graduate Reserach Assistant, under the supervision of [Dr. Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml). I’m working on empathetic and emotionally intelligent dialogue systems. I am interested in using these systems for mental health and emotional support. Feel free to contact me via Email for collaboration on anything interesting and useful.
