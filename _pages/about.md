<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6px">
Hey!
I'm Sahand (aka Sam or Â±±ÂßÜ), currently a  <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">second-year PhD</a> student at <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">Tsinghua University's Conversational AI lab (THU CoAI)</a>, advised by Prof. Minlie Huang. 
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University in 2020 and my Master's degree at Tsinghua University in 2022, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 8px">
My research mainly revolves around <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">Emotional Intelligence</a> in Natural Language Processing, specifically in the domain of open-domain conversational agents or <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">chatbots</a>. 
This line of work aims to enable these agents to better engage with users through <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">modeling human behavior</a> by understanding <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">user's emotions</a>, demonstrating <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">empathy</a>, and providing appropriate <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">support and companionship</a>.
More recently, I have shifted my focus to more task-specific cases of this research direction to explore the use of agents in <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">mental health support</a>.
With the worldwide prevalence of mental health issues and mental distress becoming a more critical issue in our society, such models can help facilitate <a style="pointer-events: none; text-decoration: none">affordable and available support</a> for those in need.

In summary,
</div>
- üíª I‚Äôm currently work on emotionally intelligent dialogue systems and learning a lot! 
- ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm interested in using dialogue systems for mental health and emotional support.
- ü§ù I‚Äôm open to collaborate on interesting projects! Reach me through Email.
