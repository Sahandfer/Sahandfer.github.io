Hello there!
I'm Sahand Sabour (Sam or Â±±ÂßÜ). I'm currently working in the Conversational AI (CoAI) lab at Tsinghua University, and am lucky enough to have Dr. Minlie Huang as my advisor. My current main research focus is on implemening emotional intelligence (anywhere from understanding emotions to being empathetic) in language models and leveraging these models in emotional and mental health support applications. In summary,

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning a lot! 
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on emotionally intelligent dialogue systems.
- üë®‚Äçüî¨ I'm interested in using dialogue systems for mental health and emotional support.
- ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on anything interesting and useful
- üì´ Reach me through Email for collaboration or other inquiries.
